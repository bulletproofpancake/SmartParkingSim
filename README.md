# Smart Parking Simulator

This project simulates a smart parking system that would give an available parking slot to the user closest to their desired destination.

The smart parking system would need the following data in order to determine the parking slot to give to the user:
- The number of parking slots available
- The destinations that can be visited by the user
- Accessibility for the user (General/PWD/Bank Vehicles/etc.)
